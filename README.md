# Topic: Does having a larger foul count affect World Cup outcomes? 

Things to do: 

- Find the average of fouls committed for each team and display in a scatter plot.
- Find the average of fouls suffered for each team and display in a scatter plot. 
- Find the percentage of yellow cards received, red cards received, indirect red cards received, and display in a pie chart.

### Team Roles: 

- Web Scraping / MongoDB creation  
  - Abdul
- Dashboard / HTML  
  - Kenneth
  - Tyler

### Summary:

This project will allow users to interact with the dashboard and select a specific team that participated in either the 2014, and 2018 World Cups. 

After selecting the World Cup of interest and the specific team, the dashboard will show a pie chart representing the percentage between the number of yellow cards, red cards, indirect red cards, and non disciplined fouls, and finally scatter plots with the average number of fouls committed/suffered per team over the number of matches they played.

This scatter plot will update and will highlight the users selected team so that it is visible for the user. We hope to show a representation between the average number of fouls committed/suffered and the teams final ranking in the World Cup.
